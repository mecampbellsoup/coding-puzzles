# Yaml Parsing

Given the a Yaml file of the format found in shipping.yaml parse the file so that we can access it in Ruby.

Your parsing code should return an object that allows you to access attributes using the [] operator:

    data["product"].first["sku"] => "BL394D"

The returned object should also allow you to access attributes using method calls:

    data.product.first.sku => "BL394D"
